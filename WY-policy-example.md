Wyoming Digital Asset Policies


## The bills are as follows:

* HB 19 provides an exemption for virtual currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) used within Wyoming from money transmitter laws and regulations
* HB 70 provides that a person who develops, sells or facilitates the exchange of an open blockchain token (a “consumer” or “utility” token) is not subject to specified securities and money transmission laws
* SF 111 provides that virtual currency is not subject to taxation as “property” in Wyoming.
* HB 101 provides for the maintenance of corporate records of Wyoming entities via blockchain so long as electronic keys, network signatures and digital receipts are used.
* HB 126 modifies Wyoming’s corporate code to permit the formation of “Series LLCs.” The intent of this legislation is to promote Wyoming as a jurisdiction of choice for securities formation and to compete with Delaware and Nevada for corporate registration revenue.

Each of these 5 laws would be a PupProsal. 
The PubProsals would consist of blocks, and blocks could be composed of other blocks. 
The root of every block and stack/assemblance of blocks would be codes of law.
