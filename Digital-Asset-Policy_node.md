# Digital Asset Policy

This node is designed for the development of public policy pertaining to digital assets, cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets and other emerging forms of economic utility and storage of value. 

## How to contribute

PubProsals are formally written legislative proposals that are developed though open source communities. 

These laws are easy to understand and create because they are written in block format. Each block includes:
* Abstract - spirit of the law
* Legislative Language - traditional code of law
* Smart Contract Lanugage - digital code of law

The blocks could be massive proposals or simple lines to be inserted in legislation. These blocks are stored in the central repository and can be utlized by anyone to create a PubProsal stack.
